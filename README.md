# ChatApp-Node

This is a chat-application developed using Node js.
Used Express & socket.io libraries to develope it.
 
 Using this application, you can,
 
 - chat in a room, where multiple people can join the room you created and have a group chat
 - you could share the current location through the chat app
 - you can have a p2p chat with your friend.
 - you can lock your room by clicking a lock button so that no one else would be able to join into your group
 
 People joined and left the chat will be displayed to the other active member(s).
 I have added simple html and css to increase the accessibility of this app and added auto-scrolling, few login validations etc to the app
